# Latency Benchmarking tools for Amazon Bedrock
A collection of tools to measure inference latency for foundations models in Amazon Bedrook.  
1. Measure latency for LLMs [bedrock-latency-benchmark.ipynb](./bedrock-latency-benchmark.ipynb). Measure across scenarios like: model latency with different input/output lengths, model1 vs model2, same model different AWS Regions.
2. Measure latency for text-to-image models - Coming soon.
